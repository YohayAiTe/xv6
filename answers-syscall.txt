The function that called syscall() is the function usertrap() is kernel/trap.c.
The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 0x11=17, which is the value of the a7 register (AKA x17), which is a fucntion argument register. In particular, it is the syscall to run (in this case mknod).
The value of the sstatus regsiter is 0x22, the eighth LSB is 0 (SPP), meaning the processor was in user mode previously.
